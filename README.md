# About anyconnect-vagrant
This project allows Cisco Anyconnect and Traps/Cortex to run in a VM using Vagrant.

**Please note: you need to stay logged in into the VM as long as you want to use the VPN.
On logout the VPN connection is automatically disconnected!** 

Currently, all DNS traffic is sent through the VPN.

To establish or tear down the VPN connection you can use the following scripts:

## `vpn-up.sh`

This script has to be executed locally on the host. But it only works if you are otherwise logged in
into the VM.

e.g. `./vpn-up.sh {profile name} {username} {password}`

* creates and provisions the VM (only on the first run)
* starts the VM if not running
* establishes the VPN connection
* forwards traffic through the VPN (will ask for root password to do this)

If this does not work (e.g. you are not logged in into the VM), you can use the following sub tasks:

### `connect.sh`

This script has to be executed on the VM itself. Therefore:

1. `vagrant ssh`: log in into the VM
1. `/vagrant/connect.sh up {profile name} {username} {password}`

This establishes the VPN connection. But no traffic is forwarded yet to the VPN.

### `forward.sh`

This script has to be executed locally on the host.

1. `./forward.sh`

Forward traffic from the host to the VPN. 

## `vpn-down.sh`

This script has to be executed locally on the host.

e.g. `./vpn-down.sh`

* stop forwarding of the traffic
* tear down the VPN connection

## `vpn-state.sh`

This script has to be executed locally on the host.

* check the current state of the VPN connection

## Dependencies

### Vagrant

The VM is created and configured via Vagrant. Download it here: [Downloads | Vagrant by HashiCorp](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

### VirtualBox

The VM runs in VirtualBox. Download it here:

* [Downloads â€“ Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [VirtualBox 6.1.10 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads#VirtualBox6.1.10OracleVMVirtualBoxExtensionPack)

### sshuttle

* [sshuttle/sshuttle: Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man's VPN. Forwards over ssh. Doesn't require admin. Works with Linux and MacOS. Supports DNS tunneling.](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle)

**Ubuntu**: you need to compile your own up-to-date version of sshuttle and specify the path to that binary 
in `forward.sh`

## To configure

* Obtain the AnyConnect linux installer program. Place in the file 'packages/anyconnect.tar.gz'
* Obtain the "Traps/Cortex" debian linux installer. Place in the file 'packages/cortex.deb' directory. 
* The routes which forwarded through the VPN are currently hardcoded in `forward.sh`
